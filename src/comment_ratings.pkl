Since  the  social  intentions  of  thespeaker may differ from what is perceivedby the hearer, systems that analyze humanconversations  need  to  be  able  to  extractboth the perceived and the intended socialmeaning.   We  investigate  this  differencebetween intention and perception by usinga spoken corpus of speed-dates in whichboth the speaker and the listener rated thespeaker on flirtatiousness.   Our flirtation-detection system uses prosodic, dialogue,and  lexical  features  to  detect  a  speaker\\xe2\\x80\\x99sintent to flirt with up to 71.5% accuracy,significantly  outperforming  the  baseline,but  also  outperforming  the  human  inter-locuters. Our system addresses lexical fea-ture  sparsity  given  the  small  amount  oftraining data by using an autoencoder net-work to map sparse lexical feature vectorsinto 30 compressed features.   Our analy-sis shows that humans are very poor per-ceivers of intended flirtatiousness, insteadoften projecting their own intended behav-ior onto their interlocutors.1    IntroductionDetecting human social meaning is a difficult taskfor  automatic  conversational  understanding  sys-tems.  One cause of this difficulty is the pervasivedifference between intended social signals and theuptake by the perceiver.  The cues that a speakermay  use  to  attempt  to  signal  a  particular  socialmeaning may not be the cues that the hearer fo-cuses on, leading to misperception.In  order  to  understand  the  impact  of  this  dif-ference between perception and intention, in thispaper we describe machine learning models thatcan detect both the social meaning intended by thespeaker and the social meaning perceived by thehearer.  Automated systems that detect and modelthese differences can lead both to richer sociallyaware  systems  for  conversational  understandingand mo', 'this is stimulating'), ('thly they fit with other programs in the creation of still greaterprograms.
